title: About BCO
subtitle: Beethoven. Brahms. Collaborations, Chamber Music, and Chocolate. *Our Orchestra*.
---

BCO is Yale’s premiere student-run symphony orchestra. We play great music together. And we have a lot of fun.

Here are a few of the things that make BCO, well, *BCO*:

- *Beethoven. Brahms. Borodin.* You couldn’t have BCO without Berlioz, Bach, Boulanger — all of the best composers of classical instrumental music that we (and probably you also) can’t live without. This season, we’re planning on …
- *Collaborations*. It’s what the ‘C’ stands for. BCO isn’t a walled-off monastery complete with a moat. It’s more like a band of vikings, eagerly sailing across Yale’s musical landscape to conduct trade with ensembles great and small. This season, we’ll be kidnapping (er, collaborating with) Yale’s operatic theater to perform arias. We’ll be working closely with the Yale New Music Society to premiere new orchestral pieces.
- *Chamber Music*. It’s *also* what the ‘C’ stands for. BCO isn’t just a symphony orchestra: we also put together smaller baroque ensembles and Romantic-style chamber groups — and feature them in concert. If you just can’t get enough music in your life, BCO is there for you.
- *Our* *Orchestra*. BCO is the orchestra of the students, by the students, for the students. We’re the democracy music should be. Our practice is fueled by passion, not stress. There are no hierarchies — only people who love playing together. All of this lets us do some pretty cool things.

- *Solos!*  We all love practicing concertos, but when do we ever get to *play* them? BCO plays *way* more concertos than any other orchestra — both in concert, with smaller ensembles, and informally as part of our weekly “fun hour.” (More about that below, in “What does a BCO Rehearsal Look Like?”) Every BCO member is welcome to solo with the orchestra — just tell us what you’re practicing, and we’ll help you play it *for real.*
- *World premieres, every concert*. Yale has a huge number of student composers (you might be one of them!). BCO taps this pool of talent with regular composition contests: we sight-read the entries during our “fun hour,” and together choose the most beautiful new pieces to present to the world.
- *Milky ways*. We know, this is a weird one. But a BCO rehearsal isn’t a BCO rehearsal without a big bag of the chewy chocolatey caramel treats. (Are we bribing you? Heavens, no! We just like candy.)
