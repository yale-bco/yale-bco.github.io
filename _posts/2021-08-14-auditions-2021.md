subtitle: After a long (long) year, BCO returns with ambitious new plans. Here's a peek...

'Lo there, BCO members, old and new! I'm Kincaid -- I'm honored to serve as co-president to the cause and community that is the Berkeley College Orchestra. As a proud cellist and composer, I'll be working tirelessly to further BCO's mission of enriching lives -- both of our listeners, and of us, the performers -- with music that strives for artistic perfection. 

Because BCO is entirely student-directed, we have a lot of freedom to push the boundaries of what an orchestra can do, and **we have big plans for this year**. A regular concerto feature to give more people a chance to solo with a great orchestra. A schedule of collaborations with Yale composers to commission and premiere new pieces. Chamber music concerts in your college common rooms. _That's just the beginning._

There are so many talented and passionate musicians at Yale who play beautifully, but seldom get to play outside of practice rooms. BCO has always been about giving us a chance to make music together, and share it with friends. After a long year of COVID anxieties, social distancing and living on Zoom, we're going to come back stronger than ever.
